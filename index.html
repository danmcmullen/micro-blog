				<p>Our full trip notes and photos of our Best of Italy and Croatia cruise are finally posted our travel site - <a href="https://exploretogether.lol">Explore Together</a>. We hope to have more posted here in the future.</p>
<p>It took a while to sort through the bad selfies and an inordinate number of pictures of doors. Somehow doors became a theme.</p>

				<p>Our First Cruise Complete</p>
<p>We finally made it home from our cruise around Italy, Croatia, and Montenegro in the early hours of Sunday morning.</p>
<p>I had hoped to post daily with some photos and a short write up of the day. I did manage to record some notes about each day so but here was never the time to sort through the many, many, photos taken. The on-board Wi-Fi was less than stellar and it was all I could do to make sure the photos were backed up to the cloud. This becomes very important later.</p>
<p>Now that we are back into our regular daily rhythm I will be posting each day over the next couple of weeks to <a href="https://exploretogether.lol/">exploretogether.lol</a>, created as a place to keep of record of our travels and upload our photos as we hope to make a habit of getting away more often now that our girls are grown.</p>

				<h1 id="the-perfect-albumhttpsalbumsrknightme"><a href="https://albums.rknight.me/">The Perfect Album</a></h1>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if any album is perfect but there are some that <em>speak</em> to me.</p>
<p>Queensrÿche - Operation: Mindcrime</p>
<ul>
<li>A concept album released in 1988, the year I graduated high school. A couple of years later as the band was touring on their next album, Empire, I was able to hear/see Operation: Mindcrime performed in its entirety live</li>
</ul>
<p>Dixie Dregs - Bring &lsquo;Em Back Alive</p>
<ul>
<li>Recorded live in Atlanta and released in 1992. I was introduced to this band by a roommate in college, not a band I had heard before but quickly became a staple in the CD player</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these albums are on my phone and are still listened to quite often.</p>

<p>Major software upgrade testing is going just about as expected.</p>
<p>It worked last week. It doesn&rsquo;t today. Updates to a couple of procedures is now preventing a clean database creation.</p>
<p>Confirmed with the developer the logs are clean but the tables are not being created. It works for him, just not for me.</p>
<p>No word yet from the database admin. Is it the network or new security policies that no one has been made aware of.</p>

<p>While at work this morning we started to see random issues, a web page wouldn&rsquo;t load or a login failed only to then work with a refresh or a second login attempt. Everything thing seemed a little slower.</p>
<p>And then nothing works, meaning no one works, outside of IT. Most of us are at a standstill, absolutely nothing can be done offline.</p>
<p>No attempts to let anyone know what the issue may be or why this is happening. I know no internet means no email but oddly one, we have two, internal messaging system still works. Also no phone calls, they still work, at least get the word out so managers or supervisors can let people know what is going on.</p>
<p>We <em>sort of</em> migrated to teams a few months ago. And by sort of I mean, the icon appeared on the desktop so some departments began using it. It has never officially been released. Other departments still cling to the old system.</p>
<p>We are now over 2 hours in to this outage and rumors are starting:</p>
<ul>
<li>server room has no power (my office is across the hall from the server room it is as loud as ever)</li>
<li>Were we hacked again (several years ago we were hit with a cyberattack that took is offline for almost 2 weeks)</li>
</ul>
<p>Email just came back up and the first thing I see is a <strong>Major Incident Notification</strong> sent over an hour ago for an impact to email in my inbox. Who was going to see this when email is down??</p>
<p>Still no internal systems or databases.</p>
<p>Communication is not this companies strong suit.</p>

<p>One year ago today we put the deposit down on a cruise for our 20th anniversary. Thirty days from now we will be on a plane heading for Rome before boarding our first ever cruise. Twelve days sailing around Italy and Croatia.</p>
<p>There are still a few last minute items to take care of but all the reservations have finally been made,</p>
<p>I think we are ready.</p>

				<h1 id="preparing-for-summer">Preparing for Summer</h1>
<p>At the end of last season we needed to move our trailer to a new spot. It was settled into a temporary home and was closed up for the winter. Our own piece of land, a new permanent home for our trailer is in the works, waiting on the lawyers.</p>
<p>Opening it this year has a few challenges.</p>
<p>We spent last Saturday doing a complete spring cleaning of the trailer while checking for any new damage and/or leaks and sorting out our power and water hookups as they much farther away this year. We will also need to go back to using the local &ldquo;facilities&rdquo; as there will no longer be a sewer connection.</p>
<p>Tonight we take our golf cart and a full truck back to the trailer.</p>
<p>It usually takes three or four weekends with the truck packed full each time to get everything back up. Hopefully our new trailer home be arranged this year and will have our own storage so we no longer need to bring so much back to our house.</p>

<p>I have had my Micro.blog account for years, on the free plan for most of that, but never really posted with any regularity until I switched to a paid account year ago. Still not much of a blogger, I would rather find something to photograph and share than to try and organize my thoughts into coherent sentences.</p>
<p>I have always struggled with what to say, I still do, but I see the message of so many blog to just write for yourself</p>
<p>With this Weblog Posting Month I am trying to change that. There will still be lots of photos but I will be trying to use my words more. Sorry about that.</p>
